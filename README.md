# COVID-19 World Data Visualization 

## Background

[Live Site]: (link will be updated here)

Since its emergence, COVID-19 has greatly impacted the state of the world. This interactive site aims to visualize the rise in COVID-19 cases in different countries around the world, starting from 2020, when the virus first started to spread, to the end of the year 2021. Click on a specific country on the globe to view its rise in cases over the last two years!

## Functionality & MVPs

In the COVID-19 World Data Visualization, users will be able to:
- Zoom in and out of the globe with their mouse to better click on and see the countries' dots 
- Interact with the globe with their mouse by dragging it to see another face of the Earth
- Select a country on the globe by clicking on its dot to see its COVID-19 line graph
- Hover over the country's dot and it will enlarge and change in saturation/vibrancy
- Hover over the country's dot and the country's name will show
- Toggle between the year 2020 and 2021 to see the country's data for each year

In addition, this project will include:
- A production README
